# Audit-ADS
 Analyzed an automated decision system (ADS) from Kaggle written by Gaurav Roy, which explores factors contributing to student academic performance. The ADS can be found at: www.kaggle.com/code/gauravarena/students-performance-analysis-and-prediction/notebook. The ADS uses a dataset that captures exam scores from high school students in the United States for three subjects: reading, writing, and math. The primary objective of the ADS is to determine whether non-academic factors–gender, race/ethnicity, parental education, receiving a standard or free/reduced lunch (indirect indicator for socioeconomic status), and test preparation courses– have an impact on test scores. To achieve this, the ADS performs several exploratory analyses on the dataset and subsequently trains and tests a model that predicts whether students will achieve an overall pass or fail in their exams given these non-academic factors
